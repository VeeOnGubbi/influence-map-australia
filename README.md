# Influence Map Australia

**Mapping Zionist-linked influence networks in Australia.**

This project documents the organisations, individuals, awards, and affiliations that form the spiderweb of influence between Australia and Israel — including lobby groups, financial institutions, military links, education boards, and political actors.

We track:
- ACNC-registered charities and their directors
- Lobbyist register entries and government advisers
- Recipients of the Order of Australia and Israeli honours
- Board members of Keren Hayesod, ZFA, AIJAC, AIF, Hatzofim, Beta, and others
- Cross-links to military, financial, and educational institutions
- Political donations, family dynasties, and succession patterns
- Geopolitical dealings, resource extraction, and defence ties
